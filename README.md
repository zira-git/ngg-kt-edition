# ngg-kt-edition
The Kotlin version of number_guessing_game made with IntelliJ and OpenJDK 25

# How do I play?
# Method 1
Open your IntelliJ or another IDE that has Kotlin installed with OpenJDK 25 and copy and paste the code then run it.

# Method 2
Look over to releases and click "ngg-kt-edition" and click Assets and click "ngg.jar" then execute it via terminal with the command: java -jar ngg.jar (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE JAVA 25 INSTALLED!)

# Method 3
Copy the code and paste into the Programiz Online Compiler: https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/online-compiler/

# P.S: Most online Kotlin compiler platforms throw EOF errors or deprecation errors because they aren't running OpenJDK 25 or run an older version of Kotlin
